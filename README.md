## 1. Content: 
- **PySpark_1.ipynb** *(Apache Spark with MongoDB)* 

**Note**: 
I run all file notebook in colab, but now it is having some problem with mongodb server: 
![Bug MongoDB Server](images/Bug_MongoDB_Server.png)
*(This is the code I run successfully in the past)*

Therefore, you should see the output of each cell to see every results I did with my knowledge about Spark.

- **PySpark_2.ipynb**

=> Using PySpark RDD and DataFrame to perform some querry tasks, beside PySpark_2 have some algorithm in "Data Mining" such as: Frequent patterns and association rules mining, FPgrowth, classification,...
